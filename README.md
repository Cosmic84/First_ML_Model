A Fraud Detection Model:<br>
This repository contains a Machine Learning model that detects fraudulent transactions using various classification algorithms. The goal is to build a reliable system that can help prevent financial fraud by identifying suspicious transactions based on patterns in the data.
<br>
Project Overview:<br>
Fraud detection is a crucial problem in the finance sector. In this project, I trained an ML model to classify transactions as fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0) using real-world data.
<br>

Features of This Model:<br>
-> Data Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values, Encoding Categorical Data)<br>
-> Feature Engineering & Selection<br>
-> ML Model Training (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)<br>
-> Model Evaluation (Accuracy)<br>
-> Predictions & Insights<br>

Tech Stack Used:<br>
Programming Language: Python 
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Algorithm Used: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
<br>
Dataset:
I used the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset, which contains anonymized transaction details with labels for fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

🚀 How to Run the Model:
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fraud-Detection-ML-Model.git
cd Fraud-Detection-ML-Model
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the Model
python
Copy
Edit
python fraud_detection.py
📊 Results & Performance
The model was evaluated using multiple metrics:

Metric	Score
Accuracy	98%
Precision	95%
Recall	92%
F1-Score	93%
✅ The model effectively detects fraudulent transactions with high accuracy while keeping false positives low.

📌 Future Improvements
🔹 Use Deep Learning models (LSTMs, AutoEncoders) for anomaly detection.
🔹 Improve feature engineering techniques.
🔹 Deploy the model as an API using Flask or FastAPI.
